# Hash Table
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
 return duplicate values found in two given trees

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

BigO: time: O(n): the exrcution time changes linarly with the inputs number space: O(n): the space is increase linearly with the number of inputs through the whole operation
