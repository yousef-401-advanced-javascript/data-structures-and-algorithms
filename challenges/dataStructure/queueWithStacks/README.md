## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

**Queue methods:** (enqueue, dequeue)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Queue methods ( enqueue, dequeue)) tha BIG O is O(n) for time and that because there is a loop<br />
and O(1) for the space
