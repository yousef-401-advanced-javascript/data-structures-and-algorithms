## linked list
from the resource this is a data structure for linear collection of data elements
### Challenge
write methods for linked list data structure(insert,includes, toString, append,insertBefor,insertAfter, kthFromEnd, mergelist)

### Approach & Efficiency

- for the insert method the BIG O(n) = O(1)for the time and the space 
- for the includes method the BIG O(n) = O(n)for the time and O(1) for the space
- for the toString method the BIG O(n) = O(n)for the time and the space 
- for the append method the BIG O(n) = O(n)for the time and for the space is O(1) 
- for the insertBefor method the BIG O(n) = O(n)for the time and for the space is O(1) 
- for the insertAfter method the BIG O(n) = O(n)for the time and for the space is O(1)
- for the kthFromEnd method the BIG O(n) = O(n)for the time and for the space is O(1) 
- for the mergelist method the BIG O(n) = O(n^2)for the time and for the space is O(n)
