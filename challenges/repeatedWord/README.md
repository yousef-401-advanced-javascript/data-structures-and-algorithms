<!-- Short summary or background information -->
 (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found

- (repeatedWord): tha BIG O is O(n^2) for all.and that because there is loops<br />
